## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how a lightweight large-language model (LLM) agent can supervise and control a modular material-handling system using natural language. The agent interfaces with real-time MQTT data from a mini-warehouse and dispatches commands to conveyor belts, uArm manipulators, and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs).  

The system enables:
- Natural-language warehouse control via Gradio or terminal.
- Tool-assisted planning and error handling using a ReAct-based LLM agent.
- Full integration with physical hardware over MQTT.

â”œâ”€â”€ main.py               # CLI interface for terminal usage
â”œâ”€â”€ mqtt_listener.py      # MQTT subscriber and snapshot cache
â”œâ”€â”€ models.py             # Pydantic types + MQTT message normalizer

## Project Goals

- Enable non-technical users to control an intralogistics system via natural language.
- Design and evaluate a ReAct agent capable of tool invocation, clarification, and fallback.
- Support transport orders, cancellations, planning, and live status monitoring.
- Demonstrate that a fully local, on-premise LLM (Qwen-3: Latest) can match latency and reliability needs.

## Setup & Installation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone & install
git clone https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/ifl/forschung/mmh_lab/projects/mmh_agent/human-in-loop-warehouse.git
cd .\warehouse_chat\
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt   # see requirements.txt for Python deps

```
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A running MQTT broker (default: `192.168.50.100`) (do not forget to connect to one of the mmh lab wifi networks; like `MMH_LAB_5Ghz` password: `ifl_2022` or `MMH_LAB_2Ghz` password: `ifl_2022`)
- An Ollama-compatible model (tested with `qwen3:latest`) (you need to pull it and use it locally)


## Running the System

### 1. Terminal Interface (CLI)

```bash
python main.py #make sure that you are in 'warehouse_chat' dir
```
to quit you can type: ctrl+c

You can type commands like:
```
move box 0 from conveyor_02 to container_01
cancel the current order
where is the green box?
```

The agent will:
- Chain tool calls (`find_box`, `trigger_order`, etc.)
- Wait for MQTT response to confirm success/failure
- Explain what it did, or ask for clarification

---

### 2. Gradio Web Interface

```bash
gradio app.py #make sure that you are in 'warehouse_chat' dir
```

Then open the Gradio UI in your browser (usually at http://localhost:7860).

## Available Capabilities

The agent supports natural-language queries such as:

| Example Question | What it Does |
|------------------|--------------|
| "Move box 1 to container_02" | dispatches order |
| "Where is the red box?" | Finds box position |
| "Revert the last order" | Return the box |
| "List all modules" | Returns module list |
| "Which module is closest to (x,y)?" | Runs spatial matching |
| "Why did the last order fail?" | Diagnostic reasoning |

## Tooling and Integration

- **MQTT Topics**: System listens to `mmh_cam/detected_boxes`, `base_01/order_request`, etc.
- **LLM Agent**: Built using `LangGraph`, `LangChain`, and `ChatOllama`
- **Snapshot Store**: Live MQTT messages are normalized into typed `Envelope` objects (`models.py`)
